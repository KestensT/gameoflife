# Game of Life

Using Gradle, Angular (4+) and Spring Boot (1.5.8)

## Usage

- Start the backend by running GameOfLifeApplication.java
- Start the frontend with command `npm start` from inside `gameoflife-ui/gameoflife-app`

Tip 1: Run your entire build and all (backend) tests with command `gradlew clean build` from inside the root folder (switchfully-gameoflife)
 
Tip 2: the UI won't work properly without a running backend.

Tip 3: You don't have to make any changes to the UI

## First time usage

- Install Node.js
- Install Npm
- Run `npm install` from inside from inside `gameoflife-ui/gameoflife-app`
